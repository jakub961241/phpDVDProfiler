	- boxset association doesn't occur when searching. This is
	  because I can't get the records to order properly.
	  [Known limitation: search results span across boxset parents,
	   SQL ordering can't guarantee parents before children.]

	FIXED:
	- collection=loaned now includes boxchildren via subquery
	- TitlesPerPage userpref added (cookie: titlesperpage)
	- pagination now shows numbered pages (AJAX sidebar)
	- boxset spacing improved (CSS: toggle button, left border for children)
	- GD library check added (resize_jpg, fetch_covers, ws.php)
	- update offset bug: reset offset on file size change, stricter <DVD> tag matching
